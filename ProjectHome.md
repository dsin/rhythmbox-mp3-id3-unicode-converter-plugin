# Deprecated #
This project is no longer support by developer.

# Introduction #
This is [Rhythmbox](http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/) Plugin that convert unreadable id3 tag to readable utf-8 id3 tag on-the-fly.

# Which languages are supported right now ? #

  * tis-620 : Thai language ( ภาษาไทย )

  * [windows-1250](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1250) : Central European and Eastern European languages that use Latin script, such as Polish, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Slovene, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Romanian and Albanian. It may also be used with the German language

  * and others in the future

# How it works #
When you add your song to Rhythmbox's library, ID3 Unicode automatically converts the metadata of the song to UTF-8 <s>and save back to the song</s> and show the readable playlist. It's very natural and easy if we use Rhythmbox as a main music player. We just do the same way that we did.

# Installation #
1. extract id3unicode to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/

If there are no plugins folder, just create it.

2. start Rhythmbox and enable "ID3 Unicode" at
Edit > Plugins

3. enjoy your music

In ubuntu 10.10, the folder will be at ~/.local/share/rhythmbox ? Thank you very much to [supersasho](http://dsin.blogspot.com/2010/07/ubuntu-rhythmbox.html#c7062056600238517089) for this suggestion.

# More encoding ? #
Other than supporting encoding, this plugin can also convert other id3 metadata encoding.

You can simply add it to variable called 'charsets' by yourself.

However, please notify me about any other encoding, so that I can add it to the trunk. Then the other who face the same encoding problem do not need to do that again.

Thanks
